# Upload Code to GitHub Repository

The current local repository is already configured with the remote `origin` pointing to `https://github.com/91vip666/classos-new.git`. I will now proceed to commit the recent changes and push them to the remote repository.

## Implementation Steps:

### 1. Stage and Commit Changes
- Stage all modified, deleted, and untracked files in the workspace.
- Create a commit with the message: `"feat: comprehensive bug fixes, SEO optimization, and codebase cleanup"`.

### 2. Push to GitHub
- Execute `git push origin main` to upload the committed code to the `main` branch on GitHub.

### 3. Verify Upload
- Confirm the successful execution of the push command.

**Note**: This operation assumes that the current environment has the necessary permissions (SSH key or Personal Access Token) to push to the specified repository. If authentication is required, you may need to provide credentials in the terminal.

Please confirm if you would like me to proceed with these steps.
